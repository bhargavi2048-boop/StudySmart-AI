🌿 StudySmart AI
A Smarter Way to Plan, Learn, and Stay Consistent
Because studying is not just about time — it’s about confidence, focus, and behavior.

🧩 The Idea Behind StudySmart AI
Students often fail not because they don’t study,
but because they don’t know what to study, when to study, and how much to study.

Most planners:
Treat all subjects equally
Ignore weak areas
Don’t adapt over time
Don’t support collaboration
StudySmart AI rethinks study planning by combining confidence-based logic, adaptive scheduling, and peer accountability into one simple system.

🎯 What This Project Does

StudySmart AI is an AI-inspired study planning web application that helps students:
Understand their weak and strong subjects
Automatically generate a realistic weekly timetable
Receive daily study guidance
Invite friends and study together
Maintain consistency without burnout
This is not just a timetable generator — it is a learning support system.

🧠 Core Concepts Used
🔹 Confidence-Based Intelligence
Students assign confidence levels to subjects.

The system uses this input to:
Allocate more time to weak subjects
Reduce unnecessary time on strong subjects
Balance workload across the week

🔹 Adaptive Weekly Planner

The timetable is:
Automatically generated
Distributed evenly
Designed to reduce cognitive overload

🔹 Behavioral Study Guidance

Instead of generic motivation:
The system gives actionable tips
Suggestions change based on confidence
Focus is on what to do today

🔹 Peer Accountability System

Students can:
Invite friends via email-based invite links
Accept invitations and access the planner
Create a healthy, collaborative study environment

(Email delivery is designed as a future extension for security and scalability.)
